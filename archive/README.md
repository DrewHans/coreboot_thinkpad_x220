# Coreboot Config File Archive

This directory contains past coreboot.config files that I have used to boot my Lenovo Thinkpad X220 laptop.

Each subdirectory is for a different version of coreboot.

Note to future-self, remember to update these variable values as necessary when compiling new images:
- CONFIG_BOOTSPLASH_FILE
- CONFIG_IFD_BIN_PATH
- CONFIG_ME_BIN_PATH
- CONFIG_GBE_BIN_PATH
- CONFIG_VGA_BIOS_FILE
